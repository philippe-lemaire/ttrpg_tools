<h1>Welcome to the Monolith GM assistant</h1>

<p>
Monolith is a science-fiction adventure game for one Game Master (GM) and at least one other player.
Players act as daring adventurers exploring a vast & mysterious galaxy filled with weird aliens, lost civilizations, and ruthless factions.</p>

<p>Monolith was developed as a sci-fi hack of Yochai Galâ€™s Cairn, which is a hack of Into the Odd (by Chris McDowall) and Knave (by Ben Milton).
    Monolith was written by Adam Hensley and its text is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 </p>
