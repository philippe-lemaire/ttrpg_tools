      <h2>Weather Rules</h2>
<h3>Changing the weather</h3>
<p>At the start of
the game, roll on Weather table below or
one that youâ€™ve created to fit your setting
(the Travel Shifts table is useful for this).
Reroll whenever a 4 is rolled on the
Travel Hazard Die. See the following
suggestions for weather effects.
</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>Everything gets soaked. Heavy rain
reduces visibility, disorients, slows the
party, drowns out sound, and creates
mud. May cause flooding and landslides if
it goes on for long enough.
</p>
<h3>Hail</h3>
<p>Reduces visibility, disorients, slows
movement, and drowns out sound.
</p>
<h3>Lightning</h3>
<p>Spooks animals and ignites
things. Generally does not strike PCs (3d6
damage) unless they are asking for it.
</p>
<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>Carries scents and makes ranged

attacks difficult. Can reduce visibility if

rain or dust is present. Strong winds slow down
movement, drown out sound, and blow
things over.
</p>
<h3>Fog</h3>
<p>Reduces visibility and disorients.
</p>
        <h3>Snow</h3>
        <p>Reduces visibility and slows movement. Heavy snow also disorients.  </p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>Hot and cold weather can increase fatigue damage to unprepared PCs. Freezing or extremely hot weather may cause damage every watch.  </p>
