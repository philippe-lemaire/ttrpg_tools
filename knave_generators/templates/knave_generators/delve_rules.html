      <h2>Turns</h2>

<p>While dungeon delving, time is
tracked in 10-minute segments called
turns. Most actions (moving, searching,
fighting, resting, etc.) take up one turn.</p>

<h2>The Dungeon Hazard die</h2>
<p>At the end of
each turn, roll the Dungeon Hazard Die
and apply the result.</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th scope="col">D6</th>
        <th scope="col">Dungeon Hazard Die Results</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
{% for key, value in delve_hazards_table.items %}
{% if delve_hazard == key %}

    </tr>
{% endfor %}

<p><em>Rolled Dungeon hazard is highlighted in the table</em></p>

<h2>Crawling speed</h2>
<p>36m per turn. PCs
spend most of this time standing still and
listening, testing surfaces, and drawing
maps. At this speed, the PCs automatically
detect traps and map their environment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
<h2>Walking speed</h2>
<p>720m per turn. PCs are
surprised by all encounters and spring all
traps, but may still map the dungeon.
Walking speed is usually used when
backtracking through areas the party has
already explored.</p>

<h2>Running speed</h2>
<p>1,5 km per turn. PCs are
surprised by all encounters, spring all
traps, and cannot map their environment.
Candles are blown out. Running speed is
typically used as a last resort, usually when
the party is fleeing for their lives.</p>

<h2>Candles</h2>
<p>Candles reveal general shapes
within 6m, and details within 3m. They last
for 8 hours, or a whole dungeon crawling expedition.
10 candles fill a slot.</p>

<h2>Lanterns</h2>
<p>Lanterns are candles inside a
glass and metal case. They can be constructed with shutters for more directed
and controlled light. Like candles,
they last a whole dungeon crawling
expedition, but their case prevents them
from being blown out. Candles and
lanterns are great as emergency back-up
torches when your torches run out.</p>

<h2>Torches</h2>
<p>Torches reveal general shapes
within 12m, and details within 3m. The
brightness of torches lets the party search
areas faster (see below), but they take up a
whole slot and burn out when a 3 is rolled
on the on the Dungeon Hazard Die.</p>

<h2>Darkness</h2>
<p>In total darkness, checks
involving movement or coordination
have a -10 penalty. PCs will be surprised
by all encounters, spring all traps, and
cannot map their environment. Itâ€™s
important to never be caught in total
darkness, so bring plenty of light sources.</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>
<p>One turn spent searching a
room reveals any non-obvious features (a
statuette inside a drawer, a cracked tile,
etc.) as well as any clues to secrets. In dim
light like candlelight or lantern light, this
takes two turns instead.</p>
