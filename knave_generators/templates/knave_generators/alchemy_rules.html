      <h2>Harvesting</h2>
      <p>
Harvesting a monster part
requires 10 minutes and the proper tools.
The most useful organs are the ones that
produce the monster's special abilities,
such as a dragon's lung (fire breathing) or
a dragon's scales (fireproofing). Magical
plants can also be harvested, although
they usually grow in dangerous or lost
locations. Body parts or plants harvested
take up at least one slot, due to the
packaging and fluids they must be
preserved in.</p>

<h2>Brewing</h2>
<p>
Brewing a potion requires a
fire, a cauldron, ingredients, and four
hours (one watch) of time. The player
describes the effect and duration of the
potion they are trying to make, along with
the ingredients to be used (usually
monster parts, but in theory any rare
substances with the right properties could
be used). If the GM approves the attempt,
the PC makes an INT check. The PC adds
+5 to the check if they spend an additional
watch brewing. On a success, the potion is
created. The parts are lost no matter the
outcome. If the PC succeeds at the check
by 10 or more, they have created a recipe
for that potion and no longer need to
make a brewing check to make it when
using those exact ingredients.
</p>

<h2>Potion Effects</h2>
    <p>
Potions allow the
drinker to produce a single significant
magical effect. If the effect is ongoing (like
invisibility) it lass for 10 minutes (one
turn). Weak ongoing effects may last for
an hour or even a day if they are very
weak. A drop of a potion gives a clue as to
its effects. If the players find or buy a
potion you can either use one of the
examples to the right or generate
something using the magic tables.

    <h2>Rolled Potion</h2>
    <p>Here is a randomly generated potion using the tables in Knave 2nd Edition.</p>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="card m-2" style="width: 36rem;">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">{{rolled_potion.name|title}}</h5>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">
            {{rolled_potion.texture}} texture and {{rolled_potion.taste|lower}} taste.
        </h6>
        <p class="card-text"><b>{{rolled_potion.color}}</b> color.</p>
        <p class="card-text">To brew this, youâ€™ll need to harvest the relevant ingredient (monster parts probably) and <b>{{rolled_potion.ingredient|lower}}.</b></p>
